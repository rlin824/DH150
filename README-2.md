### DH150 Assignment01: Heuristic Evaluation by Rebecca Lin

As mental health awareness grows in modern times, digital technology offers more convenient methods for people to take charge of their own mental wellbeing. Particularly, utilizing personal data in the practice of mood tracking has become easier with personal mood tracking apps. Mood tracking is important as it allows people to reflect and notice patterns in their mood to narrow down stressors, identify patterns, and promote valuable introspection. What many of these apps lack, however, is the ability to be integrated into a larger healthcare approach and to tap into a support system that is so crucial to mental health. Digital technology that simply focuses on the individual can eventually isolate the user, but when it is used in a way that connects people, it can open up new avenues for people to feel supported, understood, and cared for.

The Mood app is a combination of a mood tracker and community board. It allows the user to record thoughts and moods privately, as well as offers the option to post publicly to the app's community of users with a sense of support through both a "Let It Out" status update section and realtime "Live Vent" feature. Though the concept is unique and valuable, the user experience seems limited and unfinished for both the personal, individual experience, as well as the social aspect of the app. Lack of user freedom and a non-intuitive layout make the mood tracking process seem less personal, and the constrained functions of the community features fails to actually facilitate real human connection and support. Overall, I believe that to achieve its goals, the Mood app should better restructure its UX to create a seamless transition between its individual and community functions, rather than trying to approach the app with 2 different functions that both appear incomplete.  

### #1: Visibility of system status
Though the app does provide an icon for you to add a text description to a mood entry, it would be more effective to present it as a second step in the process of posting a mood entry (perhaps as a tab at the top of the screen or to have a progress bar since the icons get covered by the entry mood emoticons). Some people may want to add a description each time to their mood entry, but may skip over the icon and accidentally immediately post the status. (1)

The arrow button after selecting the mood immediately posts the status; it should indicate that the app is about to post the mood entry. (3)

### #2: Match between system and the real world
The app describes itself as a “journal,” but the layout doesn’t feel natural to or personal like its name. The homepage has a news feed style with a basic scroll that's better described as a "log," since it also posts user actions like "you went live 5 minutes ago."  (2)

### #3: User control and freedom
The user cannot delete or edit a mood entry. Though it makes sense for the user to not have entries be editable as a more accurate representation of his/her mood in the current moment, it can be frustrating if the user accidentally chooses the wrong mood description or forgets to add a text description when they originally meant to. (3)

While you can add custom mood options, you cannot delete moods from the preloaded list of moods. A user may want to delete a mood that they don't feel suits them and clutters up the posting process. (2) 

User can post only under preselected "Let It Out" categories. (3)

User can only choose from a preloaded list of response to other users' "Let It Out" posts. (3)

### #4: Consistency and standards
The app does not have an intuitive layout. The homepage has a news feed style layout that is similar to Facebook or Instagram, but not as visually similar, making the user have to re-learn how to navigate and read entries. Apps also commonly have their most important actions in a dash at the bottom of the screen, but this app hides the powerful graphical analyze feature in the corner of the screen, where the search option often is. (3)

### #5: Error prevention
There is no confirmation notification when posting a new mood entry. (3)

### #6: Recognition rather than recall
“Vent Live” and “Let It Out” icons look similar. Maybe the "Vent Live" icon should have some red Live indication to differentiate it from Let It Out to avoid accidentally starting a live vent session. (1)

### #7: Flexibility and efficiency of use
Even though posting a mood entry does not take too long, a shortcut/quick add mood entry option on the news feed with commonly used moods would help if someone wants to add a mood entry but does not have time to go through the whole posting process. (1) 

Having a notification to track mood and quick add from notification would also help for those mood tracking on the go. (1)

### #8: Aesthetic and minimalist design
Design is clean and minimalistic, but color choices can be hard to read for users (red search bar with non-contrasting text). The app changes color schemes to match the current mood entries of the user, but that can be jarring when re-opening the app and frustrating for the user who cannot edit the color scheme. (2)

### #9: Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
There are no error messages. App occasionally crashes when user tries to open it without any indication of what the error is. (3)

### #10: Help and documentation
There is no help/FAQ section. There is an about section (“What is Mood?”) that describes different uses and functions of the features, but it would help to have a tutorial or a walkthrough of the app at easy access. (3)

## Heuristic Evaluation 2: Moodtrack

Moodtrack is an app that markets itself as a "social diary." Its structure, compared to Mood, is built around its social component, while also allowing the user to keep a personal log of his/her moods in a convenient personal profile, displaying mood entries in a graphical format and ranking mood status words by frequency. I think Moodtrack has a much better balance and integration of personal mood tracking services and a community aspect than Mood. Because it focuses on this social media-like function of mood posting, Moodtrack would benefit from an overhaul of its structure to more resemble the typical UX of large social media sites.

### #1: Visibility of system status
The app generally has good visibility of system status--all buttons change color when clicked, a loading icon appears when scrolling down for new posts on the feed, even the data points get highlighted when you click on the associated mood words in each user's mood graphs. (0)

### #2: Match between system and the real world
The "Everyone" page is supposed to be like a social media status update feed, but the layout is visually not modeled after sites like Twitter or Facebook. Usually the username is displayed and highlighted before the status, but in this case, the status is shown first, while the username is buried below the text. It makes the feed hard to read. (3)

### #3: User control and freedom
There is no way to edit your account username once you set it. As a public app, the user may want to be able to change profile information. (2)

### #4: Consistency and standards
The search function and icon in the "Everyone" news feed on first instinct suggest that it would search for keywords, rather than usernames. The icon could better indicate the it is a user search. (2)

In the menu on the left hand side, some links lead you to actual pages, while other simply open up pop up windows that you have to click out of to exit, making the user experience less seamless. (2)

The buttons on the mood log page make it difficult to explore moods by date. The "+" and "-" signs are not as intuitive as a magnifying glass for zooming in/out on the timeline and could potentially confuse the user when trying to make a new post. (2)

### #5: Error prevention
There is no confirmation notification when posting a new mood entry, but the "Add" button does make it clear that the user is adding an entry. (1)

### #6: Recognition rather than recall
The app uses a spectrum of 5 different colors to indicate varying levels of mood, but because the colors are not very intuitively graded (like in a gradient), it is difficult for the user to remember what feelings each color corresponds to and makes the posts on the news feed less maningful. It would help to have icons or emoticons associated with each color to remember the emotion, rather than staying so text heavy. (3)

### #7: Flexibility and efficiency of use
An integral part of the app is that the user is able to keep track of moods and share posts, but the button to start a new post is buried within the "Me" tab, making the app less efficient to use. Having it readily available in the header would be more intuitive. (2)

### #8: Aesthetic and minimalist design
The "Everyone" news feed is extremely text heavy and cluttered, with little negative space to differentiate different users' posts. It is hard to read. (3)

### #9: Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
There seem to be no error messages. Occasionally the app would not load a person's mood chart, and there was no way to refresh the page or know what went wrong. (3) 

### #10: Help and documentation
There is a misleading help tab, but when you tap on the page, it just brings up a pop up message to send feedback to the creators. There is no documentation of help issues or guide to the app. (3)
