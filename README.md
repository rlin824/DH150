# ShareMood
## DH150 2020W Rebecca Lin

### Introduction
ShareMood is a novel UX design of a mobile app to make mental health resources more accessible for college students. With tight schedules, heavy courseloads, and busy lifestyles, college students often find themselves neglecting their mental health until it reaches a point that cannot be ignored. By creating a centralized hub that integrates daily planning with mental health resources such as personal mood tracking and on-the-go access to social support from peers and mental health professionals, I hoped to make an app that students would be motivated to use in their daily schedules.

### Design Statement
My initial design goal was to make a more useful mood tracking app. Despite mood tracking being an easy and convenient daily mental health practice, it can be limited in its benefits when used alone. Exploring current offerings on the market, I found several _social_ mood tracking apps that supplemented a daily mood log with a social feed aspect, but few that really left users feeling like they knew what to do with the data they were collecting. Building off this idea, I wanted to see how mental health resources could be more easily accessible and made relevant to students' needs, as having multiple apps for mental health is not convenient for college students who live busy lives. By integrating mental health practices and resources with a student's scheduling tools and campus life, ShareMood could promote the idea among college students that mental care is a daily practice and should be prioritized.

### Competitor analysis
#### Heuristic Evaluation
I chose two popular social mood tracking apps, Mood and Moodtrack, available on the app store in order to guide my design journey. Conducting a heuristic evaluation, I wanted to analyze how available mood tracking apps function. I found major issues in both apps regarding user control and freedom, and they both lacked an intuitive layout with confusing functions.

#### Usability Testing
Because both of these apps were geared toward a mass market, I wanted to get more insight into how specifically a college student would interact with them. I conducted a usability test with a UCLA senior looking at three routine tasks that addressed the mood tracking and social support goals of the Moodtrack app: (1) Making a new mood entry, (2) Analyzing past mood logs, and (3) Engaging with other users on the app.

Though my participant found relative ease completing the tasks, I was able to note through her journey confusing buttons and features that complicated the user experience. Her responses helped to confirm students' desire and need for such an app, as well as the lack of navigability on current apps that can make it hard for users to engage with the app most effectively.

### User Research
Through the usability testing, I was able to learn a lot about how an average college student may use a mood tracking app, but I wanted more insight into what sort of additional features college students would most benefit from in regards to mental health resources. In my contextual inquiry, I interviewed a UCLA student also living with depression and anxiety to see what mental health tools she currently uses in her daily lives. Most notably the participant mentioned how she would benefit from using a mood tracker that is better integrated into her daily life planner, which helped me to reshift my focus in the design process.

### UX Storytelling
I created three personas and user journeys based on different college students' needs.

#### Persona 1: "Gen Z"

### Wireframe and Low-fidelity Prototype (Wireflow and Testing)
Based on the usability testing, contextual inquiry, and user personas and scenarios, I created a low-fidelity prototype with wireframes and wireflow to map out three tasks: (1) user sign up, (2) customizing journal options, and (3) creating a journal entry. I tested this wireflow with a user to evaluate if the wireframe progression would be user-friendly. I learned that I had to make changes in clarifying button and page functions and making sure to add exit/back buttons.

### High-Fidelity Prototype
Using Figma, I created a high-fidelity prototype from the wireflow with a modern interface that was easy to navigate and personable for the college student. I utilized a calming color scheme to match the goals of the app, with rounded buttons and a sans serif font to to establish a comfortable look.

### Conclusion: Lessons Learned
Having no prior experience in UX/UI, I was exposed to an entirely new process of research and testing that goes into creating a good user experience. It really drove home the idea that every design decision should be deliberate and informed. Having graphic design experience, I realized I would often get sidetracked by creating the interface design, which distracted me from the original goals of the UX design process, and in the end, I felt like I had abandoned some of the insights I gained through user research and didn't get to fully execute my application idea. Now I know that people will always choose the app that is functional over the app that is simply beautiful and doesn't consider the user; I am much more appreciative of the elements that go into UX design, such as predicting and understanding user behavior, user accessibility standards, and attention to detail to buttons and exits. From the user perspective, it is easy to take what is given at face value, but it truly requires incredible planning and research to create an "easy-to-use" app, and there are no shortcuts to the design process.

Though it was tedious at times, I enjoyed seeing the parallels between my psychology coursework and the user research process. It is so important to step into the shoes of the target user as their user journeys and perceptions can differ a lot from your own. I am happy to see ways in which I can apply what I have learned in my major in tangible ways outside of the lab and in combination with my interests in design, and I will definitely continue to explore the UX/UI field.
