# ShareMood
## DH150 2020W Rebecca Lin

### Introduction
ShareMood is a novel UX design of a mobile app to make mental health resources more accessible for college students. With tight schedules, heavy courseloads, and busy lifestyles, college students often find themselves neglecting their mental health until it reaches a point that cannot be ignored. By creating a centralized hub that integrates daily planning with mental health resources such as personal mood tracking and on-the-go access to social support from peers and mental health professionals, I hoped to make an app that students would be motivated to use in their daily schedules.

### Design Statement
My initial design goal was to make a more useful mood tracking app. Despite mood tracking being an easy and convenient daily mental health practice, it can be limited in its benefits when used alone. Exploring current offerings on the market, I found several _social_ mood tracking apps that supplemented a daily mood log with a social feed aspect, but few that really left users feeling like they knew what to do with the data they were collecting. Building off this idea, I wanted to see how mental health resources could be more easily accessible and made relevant to students' needs, as having multiple apps for mental health is not convenient for college students who live busy lives. By integrating mental health practices and resources into a student's academic and campus life, ShareMood could promote the idea that mental care is a daily practice and should be prioritized.

### Competitor analysis
#### Heuristic Evaluation
I chose two popular social mood tracking apps, Mood and Moodtrack, available on the app store in order to guide my design journey. Conducting a heuristic evaluation, I wanted to analyze how available mood tracking apps function. I found major issues in both apps regarding user control and freedom, and they both lacked an intuitive layout with confusing functions.

#### Usability Testing
Because both of these apps were geared toward a mass market, I wanted to get more insight into how specifically a college student would interact with these apps. I conducted a usability test with a UCLA senior looking at three routine tasks that addressed the mood tracking and social support goals of the Moodtrack app: (1) Making a new mood entry, (2) Analyzing past mood logs, and (3) Engaging with other users on the app.

Though my participant found relative ease completing the tasks, I was able to note through her journey confusing buttons and features that complicated the user experience. Her responses helped to confirm students' desire and need for such an app, as well as the lack of navigability on current apps that can make it hard for users to engage with the app most effectively.

### User Research:
Through the usability testing, I was able to learn a lot about how an average college student may use a mood tracking app, but I wanted more insight into what sort of additional features college students would most benefit from in regards to mental health resources. In my contextual inquiry, I interviewed a UCLA student also living with depression and anxiety to see what mental health tools they currently use in their daily lives. The participant notably mentioned how she would benefit from using a mood tracker that is better integrated into her daily life.
