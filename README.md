# ShareMood
## DH150 2020W Rebecca Lin

### Introduction
ShareMood is a novel UX design of a mobile app to make mental health resources more accessible for college students. With tight schedules, heavy coursework, and busy lifestyles, college students often find themselves neglecting their mental health in order to get all that they have to do done. By creating a centralized hub that integrates daily planning with mental health resources such as personal mood tracking and on-the-go access to social support from peers and mental health professionals, I hoped to make an app that students would be motivated to use in their daily schedules.

### Design Statement
I began with the initial idea to make a mood tracking app, but realized that despite mood tracking being an easy and convenient daily mental health practice, it can be unhelpful in isolation. Mood tracking apps ranged from being as simple as daily journal to having a live feed to chat with others. Learning about mental health in my courses, I know that social support is extremely important for our wellbeing, and have a robust range of support can bolster one's mood and mental wellness. Having multiple apps for mental health is not convenient for college students who live busy lives; by making an app that is catered toward a student's needs to check their calendars, schedule appointments, and stop to reflect, ShareMood could promote the idea that mental care is a daily practice and should be prioritized.

### Competitor analysis: Heuristic Evaluation [assignment01 & 02]:
I chose two popular mood tracking apps available on the app store in roder to guide my design journey and to see what was on the market. I went with the two apps Mood and TrackMood. Using a heuristic test, I wanted to evaluate how available mood tracking apps function.

to  I started off with doing heuristic test to explore in greater depth the areas of the app that could be improved. I analyzed issues particularly in its flexibility and efficiency of use and its consistency and standards.
 I aim to recognize, detect and analyze both websites following Jakob Nielsenâ€™s 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design to identify usability problems.
