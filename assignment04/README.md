# ShareMood
## Assignment04: Contextual Inquiry by Rebecca Lin

### Project Design Challenge
Moodtrack Social Diary is a mobile application that serves as a mood tracker with social functionality. Users can choose to post in their own personal diary and/or engage with other users who are also sharing their moods on the app's community feed. It is designed to offer users access to social support while also having a personal record to track their mood as a more comprehensive mental health resource. An alternative to digital mood trackers like Moodtrack include journaling (both the popular bullet journaling method or freewriting); however, Moodtrack is unique in its built-in social functionality that can connect the user with social support for an anonymous space to vent. Digital technology can also improve the journaling experience by offering an on-the-go, convenient, and inconspicuous way to record thoughts in the moment, along with an easy way to integrate other mental health habits into one easy-to-access place.

### Target User
While the user for the Moodtrack social diary can vary widely in age and backgrounds, we wanted our target user segment to focus on college students. College students suffer from stress from school and struggle with mental health issues, but lack all the resources to obtain professional help that may be expensive. They are tech-savvy, familiar with the digital space, and willing to do things on their own to cuts costs and for convenience. Always on the go, they would want to quickly track how they feel any time, any where and in the moment as a way to reflect later and better understand how their mood changes.

### Research Methods
The interview was conducted privately in the home of the user. The user could access any computer- or mobile- based applications used to track mental health. She could also easily refer to physical journals as necessary.

The interview was conducted directly with the user by me. I asked questions and tried to take notes while the user spoke. 

The interview looked at different mental health resources available to the user, then focused in on ways the user may track her mental health. We would then have the user demonstrate to us and discuss she utilized different trackers and resources. 

For each tool (there was only one), the user would go through the entering a new journal entry, and then explain her process and reasoning. I observed the physical journal in front of me and asked questions to clarify what was said or to connect what was said to a greater theme of mental health resources. I tried to repeat back what was said to confirm observations. 

I concluded the interviews by thanking the user and asking for any follow-up questions.

### Reflection
I definitely got a lot of insight into potential users' goals, motivations, and expectations for an integrated mood tracker/mental health app experience. The user was extremely responsive and willing to expand on her answers. However, this was done by steering away from the script a little bit. In the future, I would like to better write and practice my script to be more specific in exploring a certain activity/reaching a more specific goal. Because my script was not responsive to the user's unique answers, I had trouble rephrasing questions and tailoring them to what was said, fumbling over words at time. I would also like to work on better writing questions that avoid priming the user to answer a specific way or think a certain way for the interview. Because the user also answered a lot of questions had I prepared before I asked her, I would try to be less hesitant to repeat a question just for sake of confirmation.
