# ShareMood
## Assignment07: Low Fidelity Prototype by Rebecca Lin

### Project Description
ShareMood (name subject to change) is a mood-tracking and mental health app designed to be integrated into the college student's lifestyle. During the user research phase, I discovered that college students care about mental health and would enjoy a mood tracking app, but only if it is convenient to their busy schedules and digital lives. Designing this wireflow, I kept in mind the "Gen Z," "Struggling Senior," and "New Adult" personas as young, social, and technologically literate users that are trying to accomplish the various usage scenarios of the app, including: making and sharing a journal entry, live chat with a counselor, and new user signup and app personalization. This low fidelity prototype looks at how a potential user may interact with the app to do 3 different tasks and provides feedback for future iterations of the current flow.

### Tasks
1. Sign up for a new account
2. Customize journal settings
3. Create a new journal entry

### Wireframes/Wireflow

### User Testing
I added sticky notes to take note of comments during user testing.

- User was confused by the "School" field. (Consider adding app description/tagline on Home page - "The Mental Health App for College Students")

- User was confused by app options and how they translated to options on Control Panel. (Make sure to use same app feature labels from personalization features during sign up to actual buttons/features on app.)

- User sidetracked and went back to first task (personalization page) before finishing "Create a Journal Entry" task. Wondered what the main function(s) of app were. (Make base functions mandatory on personalization page.)

- User successfully finished all three tasks.

### Reflection
I was expecting that creating the low fidelity prototype would not take as long, but I ended up having to make several drafts to work through my thought process and to try to account for the many small details like adding next or back buttons (I forgot some even still). I also did not expect the user testing part to garner so much feedback, but I am happy with all the comments that were given, even if they were small or to clarify something, because it helps me to understand the potential user much better and where they might be confused. Based on the feedback I got from the prototype testing, I will try to more clearly delineate the purpose of each step in the sign up process. I also need to make sure there is continuity between the words and phrasing used throughout the app, as well as remember to add back/cancel buttons.
