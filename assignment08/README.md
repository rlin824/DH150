# ShareMood
## Assignment08: High Fidelity Prototype by Rebecca Lin

### Project Description
ShareMood is a mood-tracking and mental health app designed to be integrated into the college student's lifestyle. This high fidelity prototype of the app is meant to test the real usability of the app for its target users/personas (though I did not have time yet to test the prototype with users). For the process, I used Figma to model this interactive prototype from my wireframe sketches on paper. 

**TASKS**
1. Sign up for a new account + go through customization step to add planning feature 
2. Set up journal with daily prompts
3. Create a new journal entry (for a day when user is feeling insecure)

### Screen Designs

I chose this particular color palette because I wanted a harmonious and calming feel to the app, which is meant to promote mindfulness and mental wellness. The soft blue and yellow gradients make the interface relaxing to use. I chose rounded corners and sans serif fonts throughout the interface for the same reason, as well as to give a more modern feel to cater to my college-aged personas. 

Using the A11y plugin in Figma, I was able to check each frame for WCAG2.0 AA level accessibility.
