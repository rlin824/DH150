# ShareMood
## Assignment08: High Fidelity Prototype by Rebecca Lin

### Project Description
ShareMood is a mood-tracking and mental health app designed to be integrated into the college student's lifestyle. During the user research phase, I discovered that college students care about mental health and would enjoy a mood tracking app, but only if it is convenient to their busy schedules and digital lives. Designing this wireflow, I kept in mind the "Gen Z," "Struggling Senior," and "New Adult" personas as young, social, and technologically literate users that are trying to accomplish the various usage scenarios of the app, including: making and sharing a journal entry, live chat with a counselor, and new user signup and app personalization. 

**TASKS**
1. Sign up for a new account
2. Customize journal settings with daily prompts
3. Create a new journal entry
